financial nature and handle valuable assets, smart contract developers use access control to protect assets managed by smart contracts from being misused by malicious or unauthorized people. Unfortunately, programming languages used for writing smart contracts, such as Solidity, were not designed with a permission-based security model in mind. Therefore, smart contract developers implement access control checks based on their judgment and in an ad-hoc manner, which results in several vulnerabilities in smart contracts, called access control vulnerabilities. Further, the inconsistency in implementing access control makes it difficult to reason about whether a contract meets access control needs and is free of access control vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose AChecker – an approach for detecting access control vulnerabilities. Unlike prior work, AChecker does not rely on pre-defined patterns or contract transactions history. Instead, it infers access control implemented in smart contracts via static data-flow analysis. Moreover, the approach performs further symbolic-based analysis to distinguish cases when unauthorized people can obtain control of the contract as intended functionality. We evaluated AChecker on three public datasets of real-world smart contracts, including one which consists of contracts with assigned access control CVEs, and compared its effectiveness with eight analysis tools. The evaluation results showed that AChecker outperforms these tools in terms of both precision and recall. In addition, AChecker flagged vulnerabilities in 21 frequently-used contracts on Ethereum blockchain with 90% precision.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#3a7dff"><a href="https://conf.researchr.org/track/ase-2022/ase-2022-doctoral-symposium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASE 2022</a></abbr></div> <div id="issta-ds" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards Effective Static Analysis Approaches for Security Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts</div> <div class="author"> <em>Asem Ghaleb</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ase22-148.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ASE22-DS_final.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The growth in the popularity of smart contracts has been accompanied by a rise in security attacks targeting smart contracts, which have led to financial losses of millions of dollars and erosion of trust. To enable developers discover vulnerabilities in smart contracts, several static analysis tools have been proposed. However, despite the numerous bug-finding tools, security vulnerabilities abound in smart contracts, and developers rely on finding vulnerabilities manually. Our goal in this dissertation study is to expand the space of security vulnerabilities detection by proposing effective static analysis approaches for smart contracts. We study the effectiveness of the existing static analysis tools and propose solutions for security vulnerabilities detection relying on analyzing the dependency of the contract code on user inputs that lead to security vulnerabilities. Our results of evaluating static analysis tools show that existing static tools for smart contracts have significant false-negatives and false-positives. Further, the results show that our first vulnerability detection approach achieves a significant improvement in the effectiveness of detecting vulnerabilities compared to the prior work.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#369f00"><a href="https://conf.researchr.org/track/issta-2022/issta-2022-technical-papers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISSTA 2022</a></abbr></div> <div id="10.1145/3533767.3534378" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">eTainter: Detecting Gas-Related Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts</div> <div class="author"> <em>Asem Ghaleb</em>, Julia Rubin, and Karthik Pattabiraman</div> <div class="periodical"> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/issta22.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/DependableSystemsLab/eTainter" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ISSTA22-presentation.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain consumes gas paid for by users submitting contracts’ invocation requests. A contract execution proceeds as long as the users dedicate enough gas, within the limit set by Ethereum. If insufficient gas is provided, the contract execution halts and changes made during execution get reverted. Unfortunately, contracts may contain code patterns that increase execution cost, causing the contracts to run out of gas. These patterns can be manipulated by malicious attackers to induce unwanted behavior in the targeted victim contracts, e.g., Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. We call these gas-related vulnerabilities. We propose eTainter, a static analyzer for detecting gas-related vulnerabilities based on taint tracking in the bytecode of smart contracts. We evaluate eTainter by comparing it with the prior work, MadMax, on a dataset of annotated contracts. The results show that eTainter outperforms MadMax in both precision and recall, and that eTainter has a precision of 90% based on manual inspection. We also use eTainter to perform large-scale analysis of 60,612 real-world contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We find that gas-related vulnerabilities exist in 2,763 of these contracts, and that eTainter analyzes a contract in eight seconds, on average.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#369f00"><a href="https://conf.researchr.org/track/issta-2020/issta-2020-papers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISSTA 2020</a></abbr></div> <div id="10.1145/3395363.3397385" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How Effective Are Smart Contract Analysis Tools?

Therefore, it is important to enable developers to discover security vulnerabilities in smart contracts before deployment. A number of static analysis tools have been developed for finding security bugs in smart contracts. However, despite the numerous bug-finding tools, there is no systematic approach to evaluate the proposed tools and gauge their effectiveness. This paper proposes SolidiFI, an automated and systematic approach for evaluating smart contracts’ static analysis tools. SolidiFI is based on injecting bugs (i.e., code defects) into all potential locations in a smart contract to introduce targeted security vulnerabilities. SolidiFI then checks the generated buggy contract using the static analysis tools, and identifies the bugs that the tools are unable to detect (false-negatives) along with identifying the bugs reported as false-positives. SolidiFI is used to evaluate six widely-used static analysis tools, namely, Oyente, Securify, Mythril, SmartCheck, Manticore and Slither, using a set of 50 contracts injected by 9369 distinct bugs. It finds several instances of bugs that are not detected by the evaluated tools despite their claims of being able to detect such bugs, and all the tools report many false positives.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#00869f"><a href="">JCS</a></abbr></div> <div id="10.3233/JCS-191346" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Multilayer Ransomware Detection Using Grouped Registry Key Operations, File Entropy and File Signature Monitoring</div> <div class="author"> Brijesh Jethva, Issa Traoré, <em>Asem Ghaleb</em>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

In reaction to these attacks, ransomware detection has become an important topic for research in recent years. Currently, there are two broad categories of ransomware detection techniques: signature-based and behaviour-based analyses. On the one hand, signature-based detection, which mainly relies on a static analysis, can easily be evaded by code-obfuscation and encryption techniques. On the other hand, current behaviour-based models, which rely mainly on a dynamic analysis, face difficulties in accurately differentiating between user-triggered encryption from ransomware-triggered encryption. In the current paper, we present an upgraded behavioural ransomware detection model that reinforces the existing feature space with a new set of features based on grouped registry key operations, introducing a monitoring model based on combined file entropy and file signature. We analyze the new feature model by exploring and comparing three different linear machine learning techniques: SVM, logistic regression and random forest. The proposed approach helps achieve improved detection accuracy and provides the ability to detect novel ransomware. Furthermore, the proposed approach helps differentiate user-triggered encryption from ransomware-triggered encryption, allowing saving as many files as possible during an attack. To conduct our study, we use a new public ransomware detection dataset collected in our lab, which consists of 666 ransomware and 103 benign binaries. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves relatively high accuracy in detecting both previously seen and novel ransomware samples.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#00369f"><a href="">FPS 2019</a></abbr></div> <div id="10.1007/978-3-030-45371-8_22" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Detecting Ransomware in Encrypted Web Traffic</div> <div class="author"> Jaimin Modi, Issa Traore, <em>Asem Ghaleb</em>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Despite the limited amount of ransomware-specific data available in network traffic, network-level detection represents a valuable extension of system-level detection as this could provide early indication of ransomware activities and allow disrupting such activities before serious damage can take place. To address the aforementioned gap, we propose, in the current paper, a new approach for detecting ransomware in encrypted network traffic that leverages network connections, certificate information and machine learning. We leverage an existing feature model developed for general malware and develop a robust network flow behavior analysis model using machine learning that separates effectively ransomware traffic from normal traffic. We study three different classifiers: random forest, SVM and logistic regression. Experimental evaluation on a diversified dataset yields a detection rate of 99.9% and a false positive rate of 0% for random forest, the best performing of the three classifiers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#00369f"><a href="">CNS 2019</a></abbr></div> <div id="8802828" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Framework Architecture for Agentless Cloud Endpoint Security Monitoring</div> <div class="author"> <em>Asem Ghaleb</em>, Issa Traore, and Karim Ganame</div> <div class="periodical"> Jan 2019 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2019.8802828" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Cloud computing endpoints security monitoring faces more challenges compared with traditional networks due to the ephemeral nature of cloud assets. Existing endpoint security monitors use agents that must be installed on every computing host or endpoint. However, as the number of monitored instances increases, agents installation, configuration and maintenance become arduous and requires more efforts. Moreover, installed agents can increase the security threat footprint and several companies impose restrictions on using agents on every computing system. This work provides a generic agentless endpoint framework for security monitoring of cloud computing endpoints. The endpoints are accessed by the monitoring framework running on a central server. Since the monitoring framework is separate from the machines for which the monitoring is being performed, the various security models of the framework can perform data retrieval and analysis without utilizing agents executing within the endpoints. The monitoring framework retrieves transparently raw data from the monitored endpoints that are then fed to the security modules integrated with the framework. These modules analyze the received data to perform security monitoring of the target endpoints. As a use case, a real-time intrusion detection model has been implemented to detect abnormal behaviors on endpoints based on the data collected using the introduced framework.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#69009f"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-critical-infrastructure-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IJCIP</a></abbr></div> <div id="ghaleb2018plc" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">On PLC network security</div> <div class="author"> <em>Asem Ghaleb</em>, Sami Zhioua, and Ahmad Almulhem</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection</em> Jan 2018 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1874548215300421" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is an important component in modern Industrial Control Systems (ICS) particular in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.

While most of existing work in the SCADA security literature focuses on the communication between PLCs and field devices, this paper presents a network security analysis of the communication between PLCs and the engineering stations in charge of setting up and configuring them. Interestingly, this aspect of SCADA security was exploited by the most famous SCADA attack, namely, Stuxnet. Using a testbed with a common PLC device, we successfully carried out three network attacks leading to serious compromise of typical PLCs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#00369f"><a href="">WCICSS 2016</a></abbr></div> <div id="7882610" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">SCADA-SST: a SCADA security testbed</div> <div class="author"> <em>Asem Ghaleb</em>, Sami Zhioua, and Ahmad Almulhem</div> <div class="periodical"> Jan 2016 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICSS.2016.7882610" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The number of reported cybersecurity incidents on SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems increased significantly in the past few years. One contributing factor is the fact that security testing of live SCADA systems is not practical as such systems are expected to be operational 24/7. Also and most importantly, conducting live security testing on these types of systems is generally costly. A practical and cost-effective solution is to carry out security testing on a simulated version of the physical setting. The main contribution of this paper is to present a SCADA simulation environment (SCADA-SST) suitable for security testing. The simulation environment is generic, easy to setup (comes with a detailed manual), and supports hybrid architectures (involving simulated as well as physical components). We show how SCADA-SST can be used to simulate two realistic settings, namely, Water distribution and Electrical power grid. Finally, for the sake of security testing example, we show how SCADASST can be used to assess the resilience of common SCADA nodes to DOS attacks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Asem Ghaleb.
