I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) (UBC), Vancouver, where I work with [Karthik Pattabiraman](https://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/) and [Julia Rubin](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/mjulia). My research interests lie in program analysis and automated reasoning techniques with applications in software security. Specifically, my Ph.D. thesis focus is on building effective and efficient analysis techniques for detecting security vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. Previously, I have worked on the security analysis of industrial control systems (ICS), mainly, the network communication between Siemens programmable logic controllers (PLC) and the engineering stations. Through this work, I discovered three network attacks that can lead to serious compromise of PLCs. I also worked on dynamically analyzing the behavior of more than 700 ransomware samples to build ransomware detection models based on the behavior of the machine being compromised.
