I am a PhD candidate at the Uinversity of British Columbia, Vancouver, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Karthik Pattabiraman](https://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/) and [Julia Rubin](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/mjulia). My research interesets lie in program analysis and automated reasoning techniques with applications in software security.
